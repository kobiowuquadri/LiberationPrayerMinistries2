OUR SPECIAL COMMUNITY
A tiny seed of faith, nourished by the prayers of three devout Christians, was planted in 2017 to proclaim the gospel through the power of prayer. This seed, now known as Liberation Prayer Ministries, has since blossomed into a vibrant and active faith community.

Liberation Prayer Ministries has become a sanctuary for all who yearn to know God, a place of prayer and praise where the sacred texts are explored and understood. The congregation united in spirit and purpose, draws strength from one another and finds solace in their shared faith. Like the sun rising over a lush garden, this community has blossomed from humble beginnings into a vibrant testimony of love and devotion.

From those moments of connection and faith, Liberation Prayer Ministries has grown and flourished, offering a place of belonging and spiritual nourishment for all who seek it. Together, we grow in our relationship with God through prayer, worship, and the study of His word.

You are welcome.
